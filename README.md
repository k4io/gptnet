# gptnet
experiment to see what chatgpt can create quickly for static analysis mitigation, i fixed up slight errors and names, added buffer scan. chatgpt did the rest lol

todo?

make shellcode for runpe x64, encrypt, decrypt on runtime with crypted PE, execute runpe shellcode with decrypted PE



how it works:
gptcrypt opens input file from cmd
-> encrypts input file into buffer
-> opens stub.exe (stub customizable)
-> scans bytes of stub.exe for 'fuck' (buffer inside .rdata section will contain an initializer of { 'f', 'u', 'c', 'k', ... } - this was generated by create_empty_array.exe)
-> insert encrypted bytes into 1mb buffer inside stub
-> gptcrypt finished

stub hides window, initializes aes data
-> checks that first 4-1024 bytes of 1mb buffer != 0
-> concats data in buffer as to not decrypt bunch of 0s
-> decrypts data in buffer
-> runpe on decrypted data (https://gist.github.com/valinet/e27e64927db330b808c3a714c5165b0a)
